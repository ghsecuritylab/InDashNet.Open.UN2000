    <!-- Flag indicating whether the current device is "voice capable".
         If true, this means that the device supports circuit-switched
         (i.e. voice) phone calls over the telephony network, and is
         allowed to display the in-call UI while a cellular voice call is
         active.  This can be overridden to false for "data only" devices
         which can't make voice calls and don't support any in-call UI.

         Note: this flag is subtly different from the
         PackageManager.FEATURE_TELEPHONY system feature, which is
         available on *any* device with a telephony radio, even if the
         device is data-only. -->

    <!-- Whether WiFi display is supported by this device.
         There are many prerequisites for this feature to work correctly.
         Here are a few of them:
         * The WiFi radio must support WiFi P2P.
         * The WiFi radio must support concurrent connections to the WiFi display and
           to an access point.
         * The Audio Flinger audio_policy.conf file must specify a rule for the "r_submix"
           remote submix module.  This module is used to record and stream system
           audio output to the WiFi display encoder in the media server.
         * The remote submix module "audio.r_submix.default" must be installed on the device.
         * The device must be provisioned with HDCP keys (for protected content).
